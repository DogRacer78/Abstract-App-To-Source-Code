# Abstract App To Source Code
This project aims to make web app development easier with the ***'write once, produce many'*** principle. This means developers should not be hindered by creating cross platform apps by only knowing one framework.

# What can it do?
At current the framework is capable of converting an app written in python with some limitations into human readable and functional code as a web app and an electron app. It contains a simplistic MongoDB integration that can be used across multiple web and desktop clients.

## How to use
A guide on how to use the framework can be found <a href="./METHODS.md">here</a>
